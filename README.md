### Level 2: Hanoi Flood Prevention üåßÔ∏è
**Theme**: Urban flooding prevention through waste management  
**Gameplay**: Clear plastic waste from sewer drains before heavy rain floods the city streets  
**Learning Objectives**:
- 80% of Hanoi's urban flooding is caused by blocked drainage
- Hanoi's colonial-era sewer system struggles with modern waste volumes
- Community action can prevent displacement of thousands of families

**Challenge**: Players have limited time before rain starts. Water level rises when sewers are blocked and drains when sewers are clear.

**Controls**: `A/D` or `‚Üê/‚Üí` to move character, `SPACE` to pick up/drop trash
